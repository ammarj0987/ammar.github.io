<h1>CSE 332 Data Structures And Parallelism</h1>
Covers abstract data types and structures including dictionaries, balanced trees, hash tables, priority queues, and graphs; sorting; asymptotic analysis; fundamental graph algorithms including graph search, shortest path, and minimum spanning trees; multithreading and parallel algorithms.

<h1>CSE 331 Software Design And Implementation</h1>
Explores concepts and techniques for design and construction of reliable and maintainable software systems in modern high-level languages: specifications; program structure and design; program-correctness approaches, including testing; and event-driven programming (e.g., graphical user interface).

<h1>CSE 333 Systems Programming</h1>
Includes substantial programming experience in languages that expose machine characteristics and low-level data representation (e.g., C and C++); explicit memory management; modern libraries and language features; interacting with operating-system services; introduction to concurrent programming.

<h1>CSE 344 Introduction To Data Management</h1>
Introduces database management systems and writing applications that use such systems; data models (e.g., relational, semi-structured), query languages (e.g., SQL, XQuery), language bindings, conceptual modeling, transactions, security, database tuning, data warehousing, parallelism, and web-data management.

<h1>CSE 473 Introduction To Artificial Intelligence</h1>
Principal ideas and developments in artificial intelligence: Problem solving and search, game playing, knowledge representation and reasoning, uncertainty, machine learning, natural language processing.
