<h3>Marvel Connections</h3> ([email](ammar.junejo0987@yahoo.com) for access)

<p>In this project, I used Spark frameowrk for beackend and React for frontend. The goal of this project was to find connections between Marvel superhoeroes. I loaded a csv file containing marvel superheroes and all the comics they appear in. Then with the help of my previously implemeneted graph, I initialized nodes as heroes and edges as comics. Breadth-first search alogorithm was used to find the common comic books in the graph. The user can search and select two superheroes from Marvel Universe and when Find connection is clicked, All the books that the two superheroes appear in together are returned.</p>
