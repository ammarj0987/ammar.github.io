<h3> Tl;dr Reddit Bot </h3> [Github](https://github.com/ammarj0987/Tl-dr-Reddit-Bot)

<p>This is a reddit bot that summarizes long posts into a few sentences so that the users do not have to read the whole post if not interested. I use PRAW API to navigate reddit and reddit API to create an account that can access posts and reply to them. For the backend, I use trained machine learning models to summarize the posts. Then I process those responses and turn them into clean replies. Then I again use PRAW and Reddit API to reply to the post with a summary of it.</p>
