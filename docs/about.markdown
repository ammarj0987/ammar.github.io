I graduated from University of Washington in 2024 with Bachelors of Science in Computer Science, where I learnt and gained experience in fundamental concepts such as Software Engineering, Computer Vision, Embedded Systems and Artifical Intelligence.
 
In my free time, I like to travel and enjoy nature. I like building PCs and playing video games. I am also an automotive enthusiast and enjoy modifying cars.
